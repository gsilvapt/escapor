# ESCAPOR

Python script to convert a given text string into an URL escaped version.

## RUNNING

`python3 sequence_escapor/escape_converter.py "var i =document.createElement('img').setAttribute('sytle', 'display:none')"`

The above command should print in our console its escaped version.

## TESTING

You can run the test suite containing in this repo with `python3 -m unittest`.

## CONTRIBUTRING

Feel free to add more features to this project. The initial idea was to develop a tool that could easily convert strings to their escaped counter-part with ease.
